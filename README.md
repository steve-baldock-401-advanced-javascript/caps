# Caps - An Event-Driven Application

* Created by Steve Baldock

## Description

* Deploy a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such as flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased. Tactically, this is an event driven application that "distributes" the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.

## User/Developer Stories

* As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up
* As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered
* As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit
* As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered
* As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered
* As a developer, I want to use industry standards for managing the state of each package
* As a developer, I want to create an event driven system so that I can write code that happens in response to events, in real time
